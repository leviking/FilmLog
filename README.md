TODO
----
 - Checkbox for whether or not a tripod was used
 - Searching
 - User registration / social logins (Being mindful of GDRP)
 - Print views for projects / films (for inserts into physical binders/dividers)
 - Seems to be a bug when specifying 15" to mean 15 seconds
 - EV option?
 - Sheets should be a table extension of Exposures since it's getting
   to be a little messy to track both roll and sheet films in the 
   same table
 - OAUTH (e.g. FB, twitter, etc.) support
