  <h1 class="page-header">Film Log</h1>
  <p>The Film Log is an application to assist keeping track of information about
  your still film rolls and sheets. This includes information about shots,
  the film used, filters, aperture, etc. The idea is this information can be
  looked up online or printed out and kept with the actual film itself.
  <a href="/static/public/print1.pdf">Here</a> is an example of a large
  format log. It has 4 exposures on one page to match the PrintFile sheets.r</p>

  <p>It can also track information for the darkroom, such as a scan of the
    contact sheet, as well as settings on a particular print.</p>

        Keep track of your film projects and films in binders which correspond to the physical
        binders the film is kept it. This is up to you to decide but organizing by year is a
        good way to go about it.</a>

        <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Then Organize Into Projects</h5>
        <p>Organize your films within a binder into projects, which could correspond to dividers in
        the binder so you can separate by film size or by a large project (such as a vacation or
        photoshoot) or however you might care to organize it.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Log Dem Films</h5>
        <p>Create a film roll and log exposures, tracking development of the roll
        and information about each exposure. You can generally provide as much
        or as little information as you like.</p>

        <p>For sheets, you still create a film "roll" but then can add each sheet
        as an exposure and provide extended information, such as the development
        and film used. This works well enough for 4x5 since you can store up to
        4 4x5 sheets in a PrintFile. For larger formats, more work may need to be
        done to make it more sensible.</p>
