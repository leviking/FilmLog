<p>First of all, don't be a dick. If you're a dick, your account will be
  deleted, optionally without notice. Cool? Cool!</p>

<p>Second, let's talk privacy. We are a big believer in it and do not want
  to ask for more information than we need to provide the service to you.
  Right now that means we do not need your e-mail address. If you provide
  one we might contact you about something with your account and while we
  work on a stable release, might let folks know when we're doing things.
  It is up to you if you want to provide one or not, but be aware we may
  have difficulty assisting you with things if you do.</p>

<p>Third, there is no warranty of any kind. Zero. You use this service with
  the understanding that securing and protecting your data is important
  to use but not guaranteed. And likewise that we take no responsibility if
  using Film Log ruins your day, your computer, etc. Use at your own risk.</p>

<p>Finally, we totes use cookies. That's how logins work. You have to
  be good with that to use the site.</p>

<p>These aren't written in legalese yet and be aware they could change as things
  evolve.</p>
