<p>First of all, don't be a dick. If you're a dick, your account will be
  deleted, optionally without notice. Cool? Cool!</p>

<p>Second, let's talk privacy. We are a big believer in it and do not want
  to ask for more information than we need to provide the service to you.
  We do ask for your e-mail address. This is, in part, to make sure accounts
  are legitimate, but also to make sure there is a means to contact you if
  there is anything critical you need to know about. Film Log is about
  organizing your films and prints. It is not about bugging you with emails.
  We will only do that if there is something important that pertains to
  the application.</p>

<p>Third, there is no warranty of any kind. Zero. You use this service with
  the understanding that securing and protecting your data is important
  to use but not guaranteed. And likewise that we take no responsibility if
  using Film Log ruins your day, your computer, etc. Use at your own risk.</p>

<p>Finally, we totes use cookies. That's how logins work. You have to
  be good with that to use the site.</p>

<p>These aren't written in legalese yet and be aware they could change as things
  evolve.</p>
