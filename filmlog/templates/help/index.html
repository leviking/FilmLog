    <p>New to The Film Log? There's a couple things you will want to do before
      you start logging films.</p>
    <p>First, go to the <a href="/gear">Gear</a> and add some Cameras. You will
      need at least one camera. You can also add Filters, Lenses and Enlarger Lenses.
      These are used, optionally, when logging film and logging print details.
      Lenses need to be associated with a camera so once you add at least one, click
      on the camera you want to associated to this Lens.</p>
    <p>Second, go to <a href="/binders">Binders</a> to create a new Binder. A binder
      is a grouping of projects and projects are then a grouping of films. How
      you organize this is up to you but a common way to do it is to have actual
      negative binders organized by year. Each project then can roughly
      correspond to a paper diver in the binder. Then each film is a PrintFile
      sheet.</p>
    <p>Thus, once you create a Binder, you can then create a Project and
      finally start logging films!</p>
